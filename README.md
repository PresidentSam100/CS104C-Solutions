# CS104C Solutions

Accepted solutions to UT Austin's [Competitive Programming (CS104C) Class](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs104c/Schedule.html) with solutions primarily written in C++ and Java (with a few Python solutions).

# Course Description

The CS 104C Competitive Programming Course explores numerous algorithms needed to solve problems similar to those found in technical interviews (LeetCode), programming contests (ICPC), and especially other algorithm-focused courses (CS 331). Oftentimes, this involves thinking about corner cases, coming up with creative usage of algorithms, and writing correct implementations under time pressure.
